# gltf2glb
GLTF to Binary GLTF (GLB) Converter

Created by Christopher Mitchell, Ph.D. et alia of Geopipe, Inc.

This project was inspired by https://github.com/Qantas94Heavy/binary-gltf-utils and started as a direct Javascript-to-Python port with a bunch of bugfixes. It implements `b3dm` headers for Cesium 3D Tiles, and will soon implement `i3dm` as well. It also includes a `packcmpt` tool for combining one or more `i3dm`/`b3dm` models into a single `cmpt` file.
